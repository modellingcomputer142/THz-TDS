## About the Project

This project uses gradient decent (optimized with adam) to fit a frequency dependent complex refractive index for an experimental transfer function. 

Trainable parameters n & k are torch.tensors with the same length as the provided frequency range. 

These are optimized to reconstruct the experimental transfer function provided.


### Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.Adam.html)

## Files and Components
`Extraction:`  
A class designed to treat experimental data in the time domain. Check notebook for usage example.  
`PINNs:`  
- `Model:` Classes and utility files for back-propagation driven fitting.
- `data:` Contains two pulses through 3mm silicon, data from NR extraction on this experiment and an example of a sequential version of the back-propagation model.  

`Notebooks:` Shows the treatment of experimental data on the Si datasets, and uses an NR numerical fit to find n and k.  

`Transfer Matrix Methods:` Uses Transfer matrix methods to simulate time domain pulses for media with multiple layers of different materials and thicknesses.
